- 👋 Hi, I’m @0dux, I'm a college student in my 2nd year of engineering in electronics and communications engineering.
- 👀 AI, VR/AR, and all other emerging new technologies are of interest to me.
- 🌱 I'm studying front-end development right now.
I'm about to finish learning JavaScript, and as soon as I can clarify my front-end thoughts and cement my knowledge, I'll also start learning backend.
I also have some knowledge of Java, Python, and Kotlin.
- 💞️ Since I'm new to open source and GitHub, I'm seeking to collaborate on pretty much everything.
